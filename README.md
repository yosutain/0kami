- **Email Creator:** Lets users design emails from various customizable elements. The emails can then be downloaded for further customization or sent directly from the application.

- **Agile Organizer:** Lets users manage any project by creating backlogs and lanes with cards representing tasks, books to read, films to watch or anything else that needs organizing.
